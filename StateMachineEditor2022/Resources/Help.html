   The State Machine editor is a Visual Studio extension used to generate state machine code from an XML skeleton  design. The XML may either be loaded using the file menu or will be created as parts are added using the editor.
 
A state machine is a set of Transitions from a starting State when an Event arrives that becomes a final State at the end of the Transition and that will perform some Action during the Transition.
 
To create a State Machine
 •Add new States using the add States window, add Event names using the event window, and the names Actions using the Actions window.
 

•Then create Transition(s) by selecting the starting and final State as well as an Event and an Action, when all 4 parts are selected press the 'Add Transition' button.
 •Before saving, enter a MachineName and from the Starting State list to set the first State the machine uses.
 

•The XML can be saved and loaded to continue an edit sesion later using the menu and the 'Save XML' button"
